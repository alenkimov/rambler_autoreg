# Type can be
#   feat     (new feature)
#   fix      (bug fix)
#   refactor (refactoring production code)
#   style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#   docs     (changes to documentation)
#   test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#   chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
#   wip      (work in progress commit to be squashed -- do not push!)**
# --------------------
# Remember to
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body.
# --------------------
# ** wip commit type
#   A wip commit should only happen on a local branch. These commits are for
#   unfinished snapshots that should not be checked into a shared branch.
#   These commits should be squashed before changes are merged to
#   a shared branch.
